          1. Have add functionality
          2. Inputs should be numbers 
          3. Output should also be number 

      Step 2: Tools will run the test cases -- we will see the test cases failing
      Step 3: We have to write out dev code to fix the above failed test cases 

      Prereq: JasmineJS, Karma 
      Karma - Test Runner ()
      JasmineJS - Testing Framework  (8 hours)
